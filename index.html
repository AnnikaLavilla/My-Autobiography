                <p> <br>Hello, everyone! My name is Annika Julia Lavilla. I was born on July 9, 2005, making me 18 years old as of now. It's incredible how time flies, isn't it?<br>

                    <br>I come from a family where education is highly valued, and I am fortunate to have parents who have always encouraged me to pursue my dreams. Growing up, I was always curious about the world around me, eager to learn and explore new things.<br>
                    
                    <br>I spent my formative years studying at MIT International School, where I've had the opportunity to engage with a diverse community of students and teachers. The school has not only provided me with a solid academic foundation but also instilled in me a love for learning and a sense of curiosity that continues to drive me forward.<br>
                    
                    <br>Outside of academics, I have a variety of interests and hobbies. I enjoy reading books on a wide range of topics, from science and technology to literature and philosophy. I also have a passion for music and have been learning to play the ukulele since I was young. I love staying fit, and have been playing football since I was 12 years old. But what I love most is painting and expressing myself through my art. In my free time, you can often find me exploring nature, taking runs, or capturing moments through photography.<br></p>

                    Growing up, I was called Kai or Ikai for my grandparents. I'm proud to say that I was an obedient child. I was always quiet and never really threw tantrums. I enjoyed spending time at the beach and eating with my grandparents. 
                    I have 3 siblings and I am the second eldest. Growing up with them was like living with instant playmates. Despite the fact that they always made me cry, I love my siblings very much and now that we are older we have a better relationship.

                    I started going to MIT International School at the age of 7 years old when I entered 1st Grade. Here I met my bestfriend, Angel. We were the polar opposites of each other. I am very grateful for her. Without her, I would have not made it through
                    gradeschool and almost the entirety of my highschool. I created good relationships here in school, some of my teachers from gradeschool I still have contact with, and I get to share good memories I had with them. 
                    <br><br>
                    <br> I was never academically smart, but I knew how to work hard for the things that I like to achieve.<br>
